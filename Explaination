Explanation:

HTML (index.html):

Dropdown menus (<select>) allow users to choose between cryptocurrencies (ETH/USDT, BNB/USDT, DOT/USDT) and time intervals (1 minute, 3 minutes, 5 minutes).
A <canvas> element is used to display the chart.
CSS (styles.css):

Basic styles are applied to center the content and make the page look clean.
JavaScript (app.js):

Global variables: These store references to the WebSocket connection (socket), the chart (chart), and previously stored data for each coin (storedData).

initializeChart: This function sets up the candlestick chart using Chart.js. It configures the axes and prepares the chart to receive data.

connectWebSocket: This function creates a WebSocket connection to Binance's WebSocket API based on the selected coin and interval. It handles incoming messages and updates the chart with new candlestick data.

addDataToChart: This function appends new candlestick data to the chart and stores it in local storage for persistence.

switchCoin: When a user switches coins, this function closes the existing WebSocket, loads stored chart data (if available), and opens a new WebSocket connection for the new coin.

switchInterval: When a user changes the time interval, this function behaves similarly to switchCoin, but it keeps the current coin and changes only the time interval.

4. How It Works:
When the page loads, the chart is initialized, and a WebSocket connection is opened for the default coin (ETH/USDT) and interval (1 minute).
Users can select a different coin or interval using the dropdowns. When they do, the chart updates accordingly, and the previous data is preserved using local storage.
The chart continuously updates as new data is received through the WebSocket.
By following this implementation, you’ll have a complete solution for real-time candlestick chart visualization with Binance’s WebSocket, data persistence, and smooth toggling between multiple coins and timeframes.
